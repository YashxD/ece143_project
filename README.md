To run streamlit locally `streamlit run main.py`

main.py contains all the code to render the frontend. When necessary, it calls functions from functions.py to generate a panda dataframe for the frontend to graph

The files in /PDFExtraction extract the data from /Resources and store it in a CSV file. It only needs to run once.
